# SECURITY

The security policy in `k0rdent/k0rdent` acts as a proxy policy for all the k0rdent sub-projects

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the k0rdent Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community members.

To report a k0rdent vulnerability:

Send an email to `k0rdent.oss@gmail.com` detailing the issue and steps
to reproduce.

The reporter(s) can expect a response within 24 hours acknowledging
the issue was received. If a response is not received within 24 hours, please
reach out to any maintainer directly to confirm receipt of the issue.


To make a report, submit your vulnerability to any of the maintainers of the particular sub-project(s). This allows triage and handling of the vulnerability with standardized response times.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in k0rdent
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects k0rdent
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that k0rdent depends on. For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there.

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning k0rdent components for security - please discuss this is in the various k0rdent community channels
- You need help applying security-related updates
- Your issue is not security-related

## Review Process

Once a maintainer has confirmed the relevance of the report, a draft security
advisory will be created on Github. The draft advisory will be used to discuss
the issue with the reporter(s), and k0rdent's maintainers.
If the reporter(s) wishes to participate in this discussion, then provide
reporter Github username(s) to be invited to the discussion. If the reporter(s)
does not wish to participate directly in the discussion, then the reporter(s)
can request to be updated regularly via email.

If the vulnerability is accepted, a timeline for developing a patch, public
disclosure, and patch release will be determined. If there is an embargo period
on public disclosure before the patch release, an announcment will be sent to
the security announce mailing list announcing the scope of the vulnerability, the date of availability of the
patch release, and the date of public disclosure. The reporter(s) are expected
to participate in the discussion of the timeline and abide by agreed upon dates
for public disclosure.

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by the security contacts within 5 working days. This will set off the [Security Release Process](#Process).

Any vulnerability information shared with the k0rdent team stays within k0rdent project and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the k0rdent Maintainers and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it is already publicly known) to a few weeks. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days. The Maintainers hold the final say when setting a disclosure date.

## Process

If you find a security-related bug in k0rdent, we kindly ask you for responsible disclosure and for giving us appropriate time to react, analyze, and develop a fix to mitigate the found security vulnerability. One of the maintainers will investigate the issue within 5 working days.

The team will react promptly to fix the security issue and its workaround/fix will be published on our release notes. 


## Security Contacts

The maintainers of each the k0rdent sub-project(s) are the security contacts for the particular sub-project(s). In case you identify any security issue, please reach out to any of the security contacts.
