k0rdent is an open-source, Kubernetes-based AIOps platform tailored for platform engineers. It unifies all AIOps infrastructure and services at scale in a Kubernetes-native manner, delivering agility and flexibility for AI workload requirements while reducing costs, complexity, and operational toil. With its composable architecture, k0rdent is easy to customize and streamlines infrastructure and service maintenance through declarative automation and production-ready templates optimized for AI workloads.

k0rdent focuses on providing a consistent and scalable approach to deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters. Think of k0rdent as a "super control plane" designed to manage other Kubernetes control planes, or as a platform engineered for Platform Engineering. Whether you're building an internal developer platform (IDP), managing Kubernetes clusters at scale, creating Golden Paths, or centralizing operations, k0rdent is a powerful tool to achieve these goals.

Whether managing Kubernetes clusters on-premises, in the cloud, or across hybrid environments, k0rdent ensures a consistent and secure approach. With full lifecycle management—including provisioning, configuration, and maintenance—k0rdent provides a repeatable, centralized, and secure way to manage Kubernetes clusters effectively.
